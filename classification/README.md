## Python dependencies
Check that you have python dependencies installed listed in `requirements.txt` file

## Download the dataset
Use `download_data.py` script

Then extract rar files into respective `{device_name}/gafgyt_attack/` and `{device_name}/mirai_attack/` directories

## Run the training and evaluation script
`train.py`

You can specify if you just want to use just top N features

`train.py 5`


## Run just the test for the existing model
As input give it the top number of features to use and the name of the model to load

`test.py 5 'model_5.h5'`
